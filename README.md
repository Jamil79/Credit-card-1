# Credit-card-1

Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Kaggle data from 2018 to better understand:
1.	How could we predict credit card fraud in the USA using a linear regression supervised machine learning model?
2.	What could be the main statistic of the credit card fraud in the USA?
3.	Are the overall credit card fraud correlated with each month fraud?

File Descriptions
The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found in the blog post on my site that I will provide as a link in the Github repository.
